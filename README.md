# Reading the Fed: A Text-Based Analysis of FOMC Statements and Market Reactions

This project investigates whether the tone of Federal Open Market Committee statements is associated with short-run movements in financial markets. The analysis uses Python to scrape FOMC statements, clean and process text, construct hawkisg/dovish tone scores, merge the tone data with market data, run simple regressions, and generate figures for a Quarto blog post.

## Question

Do more hawkish FOMC statements coincide with changes in:
- the US 2-year Treasury yield
- S&P 500 returns
- the US dollar index?

## Data

The project uses:
- FOMC statement text scraped from the Federal Reserve website
- daily market data containing the US 2-year Treasury yield, S&P 500, and US dollar index

## Project Structure

- `scripts/`: Python scripts used to scrape, clean, merge, analyse, and visualise the data
- `data/raw/`: raw input data
- `data/processed/`: cleaned and merged datasets
- `output/figures/`: static figures
- `output/interactive_figures/`: interactive Plotly figures
- `output/tables/`: summary statistics, regression results, and robustness check
- `posts/fed-text-markets/`: Quarto blog post


## How to Reproduce

### Install the required packages:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the scripts from the project root in this order:
```bash
python3 scripts/01_scrape_fed_statements.py
python3 scripts/02_clean_fed_statements.py
python3 scripts/03_build_tone_scores.py
python3 scripts/03b_compare_tone_dictionaries.py
python3 scripts/04_prepare_market_data.py
python3 scripts/05_merge_event_dataset.py
python3 scripts/06_run_analysis.py
python3 scripts/07_make_figures.py
python3 scripts/08_make_interactive_figures.py
```

### Render the Quarto website
```bash
quarto render
```

### Main Outputs
```bash
- data/processed/analysis_dataset.csv
- output/tables/summary_stats.csv
- output/tables/regression_results.csv
- output/tables/regression_summary_blog.csv
- output/tables/dictionary_comparison.csv
- output/figures/
- output/interactive_figures/
```

## Method Summary

**The tone score is calculated as:**
*Tone Score = Hawkish Count - Dovish Count*

**The normalised tone score is calculated as:**
*Normalised Tone Score = Tone Score/Word Count*

**The market reaction variables are:**
- us2yield_change: daily change in the US2-year Treasury yield
- sp500_return: daily percentage return of the S&P 500
- usd_index_change: daily percentage change in the US dollar index

## Limitations

The tone score is dictionary-based and it does not capture context, negation, or the broader policy environment to a full extent. The regressions are associations, not causal estimates.
